# Smart_Analysis_System
Conducted research and developed a system under Dr Hamam Mokayed on an intelligent analysis system for juvenile safety against gun violence using facial recognition technology by utilising real-time data from the users on the premises.
Executed the project using modules such as OpenCV, Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, MySQL, Django, and Scikit-Learn, and evaluated the classification models to identify the face analysis of several subjects at a particular time.
Achievement - Implemented supervised machine learning algorithms to identify the potential high-risk individuals with high accuracy of 99%, track their location in real-time, and add citizens, authorities and most wanted criminals to the database.
